        Hello! Welcome to Paradiso. Our name was inspired by the movie "Cinema
        Paradiso." This project began as an initiative to end the need to choose
        a movie when there are so many different options out there. You can get
        a randomly generated movie showing the title, release date, rating, and
        summary. You can also narrow your results by genre.
        <br><br>
        We are The Pink Ladies, named after the type of apple and not the Grease
        girl group. Our team is composed of three people: Mabel Felix, Corine Lu, and
        Adrian Mendoza. We are currently students as part of Google's Computer
        Science Summer Institute and this is our final project.
